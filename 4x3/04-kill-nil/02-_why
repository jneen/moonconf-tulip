                     KILL NIL

 To me, fighting NULL is the epitome of why I
 struggled as a programmer. I am not a natural
 at it, but I wanted very much to be–and I
 found no use for NULL. I never needed it, but
 it was always there. I kept pushing it down,
 painting over it, shutting it up, constantly
 checking for it–

 Are you NULL?

 Are you NULL?

 What about you?
